============
Installation
============

.. _sec:installation:

This document will guide you through the process of installing
Singularity from source with the version and location of your choice.

----------------
Before you begin
----------------

If you have an earlier version of Singularity installed, you should
remove it before executing the installation commands.

These instructions will build Singularity from source on your system.
So you will need to have some development tools installed. If you run
into missing dependencies, try installing them like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo apt-get update && \

        sudo apt-get install \

        python \

        dh-autoreconf \

        build-essential \

        libarchive-dev


.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo yum update && \

        sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' && \

        sudo yum install libarchive-devel


-------------------------
Install the master branch
-------------------------

The following commands will install the latest version of the `GitHub
repo <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity>`_ master branch to ``/usr/local``.

.. code-block:: none

    $ git clone https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git

    $ cd singularity

    $ ./autogen.sh

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc

    $ make

    $ sudo make install


.. note.. code-block:: none
    Note that the installation prefix is ``/usr/local`` but the configuration directory
    is ``/etc``. This ensures that the configuration file ``singularity.conf`` is placed in the
    standard location.

If you omit the ``--sysconfdir`` option , the configuration file will be installed in ``/usr/local/etc``.
If you omit the ``--prefix`` option, Singularity will be installed in the ``/usr/local`` directory
hierarchy by default. And if you specify a custom directory with the ``--prefix``
option, all of Singularity’s binaries and the configuration file will
be installed within that directory. This last option can be useful if
you want to install multiple versions of Singularity, install
Singularity on a shared system, or if you want to remove Singularity
easily after installing it.

--------------------------
Install a specific release
--------------------------

The following commands will install a specific release from `GitHub
releases <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases>`_ page to ``/usr/local``.

.. code-block:: none

    $ VER=2.5.1

    $ wget https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/download/$VER/singularity-$VER.tar.gz

    $ tar xvf singularity-$VER.tar.gz

    $ cd singularity-$VER

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc

    $ make

    $ sudo make install


------------------------------
Install the development branch
------------------------------

If you want to test a development branch the routine above should be
tweaked slightly:

.. code-block:: none

    $ git clone https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git

    $ cd singularity

    $ git fetch

    $ git checkout development

    $ ./autogen.sh

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc

    $ make

    $ sudo make install


---------------------
Remove an old version
---------------------

Let’s say that we installed Singularity to ``/usr/local``. To remove it completely,
you need to hit all of the following:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/libexec/singularity

    $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/etc/singularity

    $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/include/singularity

    $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/singularity

    $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/var/lib/singularity/

    $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/singularity

    $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/run-singularity

    $ sudo rm /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/singularity

    $ sudo rm /usr/local/man/man1/singularity.1


If you modified the system configuration directory, remove the ``singularity.conf`` file
there as well.
If you installed Singularity in a custom directory, you need only
remove that directory to uninstall Singularity. For instance if you
installed singularity with the ``--prefix=/some/temp/dir`` option argument pair, you can remove
Singularity like so:

.. code-block:: none

    $ sudo rm -rf /some/temp/dir
